# Professionalism at Focus Bear

## Reflection

### 1. Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?

Yes. We had great communication within the front-end team at Focus Bear, everyone was proactive in addressing blockers, openly asked for help when needed, and communicated updates clearly. Questions were encouraged, and everyone respected each other, making it a very good environment for collaborative work because everyone was given the freedom to speak up.

### 2. What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?

I will make sure that my communication is clear and respectful by avoiding making assumptions and asking questions to gain clarity, use a polite tone even if things are getting stressful, practise active listening and always try and understand the context of others. It is also important that I respect the different communication styles of others and always be open to feedback.

### 3. How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?

I can create a positive work vibe by showing appreciation for others' efforts, keeping conversations friendly and open to corrections and any feedback, there is no need to be cold and serious to maintain professional communication among team members, but remembering to be respectful, reliable and easy to communicate with. At Focus Bear this means that it is even more important for such work environment in order to be aligned with the core mission by maintaining open, honest and friendly communication and helping out wherever possible.
