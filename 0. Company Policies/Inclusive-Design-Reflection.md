# Working with Vulnerable Populations

## Reflection

1. Communication adjustments:
    - be clear and direct
    - respect any communication preferences of the individual
    - give time to express themselves without rushing
    - listen carefully
2. UX/Communication problems that can affect Focus Bear:
    - flashy/distracting animations or elements
    - large chunks of text
    - inconsistent navigation and screen layouts
    - lack of different options to adjust app settings (fonts, contrast, text size, have text-to-speech)
3. Being flexible when working because not everyone works in the same method that I do

Hey!  
I know it can be a little overwhelming at times, but please don't worry, it's okay to not have everything work to plan. I would like to help you as possible, take a break and relax.   
I'm happy with how you are doing your best, so take care of yourself!
