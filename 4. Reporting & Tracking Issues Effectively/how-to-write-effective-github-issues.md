### 1. How would you write a bug report for a crash in Focus Bear?

### 2. How can adding steps to reproduce help developers fix issues faster?

* By providing detailed steps the devs do not need to guess the exact requirements for the scenario and reduces the time to resolve the issue

### 3. If a developer asks for more details on an issue you created, what might you have missed?

* Timestamps
* Any error messages
* Configuration settings like dark mode, etc.
* Any third-party software that may be causing the issue
* Type of data input by the user
