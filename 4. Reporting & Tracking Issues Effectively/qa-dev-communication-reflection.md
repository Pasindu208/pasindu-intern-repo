# Communicating Effectively with Developers

## Reflection

### 1. If a developer says they canâ€™t reproduce a bug, how would you respond?

* Ask for details of how they attempted to replicate bugs, see if something was missed
* Offer to help replicate issues together
* Document details of how the issues couldn't be replicated and acknowledge that some bugs can be hard to find

### 2. How can testers avoid blaming developers while still pushing for bug fixes?

* Focus on the bugs and issues, not on the developers
* Work together to provide fixes
* Always present evidence so that developers are able to verify that they are not wasting their time
* Always be open to collaborate with devs

### 3. What are some techniques for keeping bug discussions constructive and professional?

* Follow a proper structure for all reports and documentation so that everything is clear, contains all required details and is organized
* Attend regular stand up meetings and all other meetings along with the developers so that I am updated on bugs status, priorities on fixes, etc
* Maintain regular feedback with developers on bugs status, bug fixing status so that any uncertainties are addressed quickly
