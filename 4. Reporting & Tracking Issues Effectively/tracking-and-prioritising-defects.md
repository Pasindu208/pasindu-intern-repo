# Tracking and Prioritising Defects

## Reflection

### 1. How would you prioritise a cosmetic UI issue vs. a login failure?

- Login failure
    - This is a high severity and high priority issue because it directly affects the user experience
    - Users are not able to access the applications' functionalities and impacting user trust, user experience, revenue
- Cosmetic UI issue
    - This is a comparatively low severity issue but can have a low-medium priority label depending on the exact nature of the cosmetic issue
    - Such bugs and issues will decrease the professional and polished look and feel of the application
    - Depending on the nature of the issue, user functionalities could also be affected

In my understanding, the priority should be based on direct user impacts and functionalities affected over cosmetic issues.

### 2. If a developer says a bug is too minor to fix, how would you respond?

- Document all bugs no matter how minor it is in severity and priority
    - include steps to reproduce the bugs
    - environment details
    - screenshots/recordings/log data
- Discuss and verify with developers
    - verify the impact on users
    - discuss probability of getting it fixed
    - reasons for not fixing
- Communicate my understanding of the bug/issue with dev team to make sure that they understand the effects of the bug

### 3. How can testers ensure that low-priority bugs donâ€™t get forgotten?

1. Use bug tracking software, and log all issues found with appropriate tags making sure that nothing is not documented
2. Review all low priority bugs in sprint meetings with dev team
3. Follow up on low priority bugs with developers
