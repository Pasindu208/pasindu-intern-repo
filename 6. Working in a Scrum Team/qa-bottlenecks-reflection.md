# Handling QA Bottlenecks in Sprints

## Reflection

### 1. If multiple features are ready for testing at the same time, how would you prioritize them?

* Consider the risk involved with each features user story and impact on users
* Estimate the time taken to test the features so that I can plan the testing schedule to efficiently finish testing
* Automate testing where possible

### 2. How can early involvement of QA prevent last-minute testing rushes?

* Stories can be verified and testing scenarios can be planned up front
* Can perform incremental testing on the features
* Can adjust according to changing priorities, development progress and blockers

### 3. What would you suggest to a team if QA keeps blocking releases due to late testing?

* Find out the reasons for the blocked testing
* Automate testing where possible
* Adjust sprints during planning to properly accommodate  the QA testing
* Review acceptance criteria for testing
