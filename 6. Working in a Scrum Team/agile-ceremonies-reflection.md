# Understanding Agile Ceremonies & QA’s Role

## Reflection

### 1. What should QA do before, during, and after a Sprint Planning meeting?

* Before:
    * Review backlog items
    * Draft test scenarios to be proposed at the meeting
* During:
    * Clarify acceptance criteria
    * Provide estimate times for testing
    * Provide information about testing environments
* After:
    * Create/update testing plans
    * Begin testing

### 2. If a Daily Standup is running long, what’s the best way to keep QA updates concise?

* Report only tests that have been completed, any blockers present, and the goals of the day
* Clearly communicate
* Postpone deeper discussions to later dates/meetings

### 3. How can QA drive continuous improvement during Sprint Retrospectives?

* Set clear objectives
* Encourage feedback, questions and discussions
* Provide insights to trends found from QA testing
