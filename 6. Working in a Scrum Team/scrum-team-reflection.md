# How to Be a Member of a Scrum Team

## Reflection

### 1. How should QA prepare for a Sprint Planning meeting?

* Review the backlog to find unclear or high risk stories that might need better acceptance criteria or clarification of acceptance criteria
* Prepare any test scenarios, edge cases and any non-functional requirements that are needed to be discussed

### 2. What information should testers share in a Daily Standup?

* Report of completed testing cases, any new defects found, test environment details used
* Report any blockers so they can be resolved
* Highlight risks found

### 3. If a feature is about to be released, but QA finds a critical bug, what should happen next?

* Report immediately to Product Owner and Scrum Masters
* Work together with the development team to find the causes and decide on the type of fix
* Document all of the steps taken
