# Agile Ceremonies & Team Collaboration

## Reflection

### 1. How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?

Ceremonies make sure that the team understands all the required goals and requirements for the features they are working on. Everyone will be in sync from the start, through the sprint and at the end. This communication will encourage feedback from within the team to help identify any blocks or improvements capable.

### 2. Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?

Sprint planning, because the QA should have a very clear understanding of the requirements so that all testing carried out is done effectively


## Task

### 1. Attend a stand-up meeting and observe how updates are shared.

### 2. Participate in a retrospective or review past notes from one.

### 3. Document one change you can make to improve your team collaboration.

We started a shared google doc for meeting notes so that everyone can contribute and make sure that everyone is in sync
