# Agile Workflows & Kanban

## Reflection

### 1. How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?

Kanban increases the visibility of the tasks that are in progress and encourages to prioritize these tasks by also limiting work in progress tasks.

### 2. How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?

Using the visual "To-Do", "In Progress", "Done" cards on the board, we are able to rank tasks according to the importance and give priority as required. The max number of tasks also promotes focus on the already started tasks so that there is no overloading and the team maintains maximum efficiency.

## Task

### 1. Check out Focus Bearâ€™s Kanban board and note how tasks are structured. (Hint: Look in GitHub Projects.)

### 2. Move at least one task through the Kanban process and update its status correctly.

### 3. Identify one way you can improve task tracking in your role.
