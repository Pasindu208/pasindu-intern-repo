# Working in an Agile Team

## Reflection

### 1. What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?

#### Benefits:

-   Flexible to changing requirements
-   Continuous product releases
-   High customer feedback
-   More focus on building the product

#### Challenges:

-   Higher chance of project scope expanding
-   Unpredictable final delivery
-   Might lack documentation compared to traditional methods
-   Requires constant feedback

### 2. How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?

-   Testing can be done every sprint instead of being carried out at the end of development
-   Continuous feedback on the product and improved collaboration with developers
-   Testing can be done in a structured manner
-   Easier and better issue tracking and bug reporting

## Task

### 1. Summarize the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in your own words.

#### Scrum:

-   Occurs in regular iterations called sprints
-   Has scrum roles such as Scrum Master, Product Owner, Dev team
-   Has sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews and retrospectives

#### Kanban:

-   Is a continuous flow of tasks being carried out
-   No fixed roles
-   Provides visualization of work to improve in-progress work

### 2. Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work.

Maintaining constant communication and feedback with the team and customers
