# Roles in an Agile Team

## Reflection

### What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?

As a QA in a front end development team, my role contributes by providing continuous quality assurance throughout such as by participating in defining acceptance criteria, writing test cases, testing at the final stages of sprints, and providing feedback.

### How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?

#### with Developers:
- provide feedback on new features and previous bugs
- help with debugging and reproducing the bugs

#### with Product Manager:
- confirming acceptance criteria
- provide QA feedback

#### with Project Manager:
- participate in sprint meetings
- solve testing issues/bottlenecks

## Task

### Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.

A QA is involved throughout the development cycle, carrying out continuous testing, providing constant feedback, working closely with developers, product and project managers to ensure product quality is maintained in all stages.

### Identify one other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.

I will collaborate with Developers most frequently. It can be improved by clear communication by attending meetings and also by starting testing as early as possible so that developers have enough time to fix bugs.
