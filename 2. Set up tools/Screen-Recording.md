# Learn about screen recording tools

## Reflection

1. What key information should you include when submitting a screen recording of a bug?
    * Info about what the bug is and where to spot it
    * Any conditions that are required for the bug to be spotted
    * How to reproduce the bug
    * Expected behaviour in contrast to what happens due to the bug
    * Environment details such as OS, App version
    * Bug severity/impact on app
2. How can you ensure sensitive information is not accidentally shared in a recording?
    * Close unrelated apps/windows
    * Blur sensitive info 
    * Turn off notifications when recording
    * Use testing accounts when possible
    * Review recordings to ensure you have not missed anything
3. If a bug only happens during fast interactions, how would you record and describe it effectively?
    * Slow down video speed
    * Use Dev Console to get logs if possible
