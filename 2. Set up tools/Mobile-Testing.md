# Set up a real mobile device for testing

## Reflection

1. What issues might only appear on a real device but not on an emulator?
    * Performance issues related to specific mobile phone models
    * Sensor data such as GPS, accelerometer, cellular networks, cameras
    * Background apps and services
2. How would you report a bug that only happens on a specific device model?
    * Include device model and OS version
    * Bug info
    * Steps to reproduce
    * Screen recording
    * Behaviour on different devices
3. If an app crashes on a physical device, what steps would you take to gather useful debugging information?
    * Steps to recreate the bug
    * Take screen recording of it occurring 
    * Collect log info
