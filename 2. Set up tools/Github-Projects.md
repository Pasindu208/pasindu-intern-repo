# Get familiar with GitHub Projects

## Reflection

1. In the GitHub repo -> Issues -> New Issue -> Fill in details -> Add labels -> Assign to a dev if needed -> Link any related pull requests or issues/milestones -> Submit 
2. Prioritize issues by:
    * adding labels
    * move issues to top of the project table
    * add to a milestone 
3. Directly link issues to pull requests, better collaboration as QA and dev in same environment, can add detailed bug reports in issues
