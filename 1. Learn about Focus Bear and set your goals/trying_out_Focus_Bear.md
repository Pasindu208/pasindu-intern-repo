#  First-Time User Experience Assignment

## Reflection Questions

### What was your first impression of the app?

My first impression of the app was that it is a good idea to have all of this focus and productivity capabilities in one app, instead of having to use different apps and websites for to-do lists, pomodoro times and habit trackers & reminders.

### Did you find anything difficult to understand?

No it was pretty straight forward to learn the app functions and stuff, but in the Windows app I would say the app windows/pop-ups need to be uniform/better managed because it is a bit distracting for me and a bit frustrating the way different pages are in different sized windows and the always on top windows.

### If you had to explain Focus Bear to a friend in one sentence, what would you say?

It is an all-in-one app for better focus, productivity and habit tracking that you can set to work all day and benefit from.

### What are some changes that could improve the new user experience?

I think the sign in with Google should be available on the Windows app because on my phone where I first installed FB I signed in with Google and had to create a new account on desktop.
