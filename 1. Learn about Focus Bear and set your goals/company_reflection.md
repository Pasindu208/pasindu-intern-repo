# Understanding of Focus Bear's mission and vision 

#### Why do you think Focus Bear was created?

I think Focus Bear was made with the short term result goal of being a "To-Do/Focusing" app that kept users focused on the task they are supposed to be doing, and a long term goal of helping its users to build good habits and practice them regularly.

#### What problem is Focus Bear solving?

Focus Bear is helping any individual who finds it difficult to focus when working, and keep up regular practices.

#### Why do you think this mission is important?

In today's fast paced world, it is very important that everyone is capable of keeping on track their tasks and also practising their good habits required for a good lifestyle. When it is hard for a person to stay focused while working, it can be very bad on their daily life.

#### How does Focus Bearâ€™s work align with your personal values or interests?

I believe that everyone should be given equal opportunities, and if anyone struggles to keep up due to any reason the necessary help is deserved. So what Focus Bear is doing is a good mission for a lot of people including me, because I am someone who finds it hard to stay focused when working on some days.

#### Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?

Yes, I am a very easily distracted person when working.
