# Compare Focus Bear with Other Productivity Apps

## Reflection

### What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?

Focus Bear is designed for the use of individuals with ADHD and ASD, while the other apps have a more general purpose design. It has features that allow custom daily routines that are implemented in a way that is effective and not available in other apps which are more focused on the distraction blocking and productivity parts.

### If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?

Because it is an all-in-one approach to productivity, and the daily routine features are rich in comparison to the others. 

### What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?

AI task scheduling like in [Tiimo](https://www.tiimoapp.com/product/ai-planning) would be very good for me personally

### Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?

I think its good overall, just needs polishing up the user experience.
