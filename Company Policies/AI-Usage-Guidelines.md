# Reflection

1. Use AI to:
   * research assistance
   * generate content ideas/outlines
   * analyse data quickly
2. Use my skills to:
   * critically analyse findings
   * write the content
   * take decisions based on analysis
3. Always making sure to use AI us a supplement to my existing skills and knowledge, so that I am able to verify its output. If I am unaware of anything required to complete my objective it is important to learn the concepts instead of just substituting it with AI generated content.
4. Steps for data privacy:
   * not provide sensitive information
   * use trusted service providers 
   * ensure that only necessary permissions are given to AI apps

# Task

**Task:** Analyse a web page that I had developed previously using ChatGPT instructed to act as my Quality Assurance professional. 

**Output:** It gave quite a detailed analysis of the screenshot that I provided, and most of the points were good, however it also mistook very slightly similar icons as the same.  
Overall, it covered the aspects of UI/UX issues, Text and content issues, Accessibility issues, and Functionality issues through the image and provided instructions to make sure that functional aspects were working as intended.

**Best practice:** I will always make sure to verify all answers obtained from AI sources if these tools are used
