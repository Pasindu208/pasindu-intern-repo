# Replicating Bugs Reported by Customer

## Reflection

### If a customer reports a crash but you canâ€™t reproduce it, what are your next steps?

If bug cannot be reproduced, verify all details provided by the user and retry. If still unsuccessful document all available information in case of future encounters of this bug.

### When should you ask developers to add more logging, and what kind of logs would help?

When unable to recreate a bug, when more details are needed for tracing a bug, if it is required to know the user interactions/actions/events (such as pressing a button, entering text, etc), and when different stack services/systems are used to get more info

### What are some common patterns in bugs that only occur for some users but not others?

Bugs related to the user's environment, permissions and access levels, device hardware issues (older hardware)
