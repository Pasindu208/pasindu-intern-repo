# Understanding Deployment & Hotfix Testing

## Reflection

### 1. If a release goes live and users immediately report issues, what should QA do?

- Handle incoming feedback from users and document and enter into tracking system after validating
- Contact dev team, collaborate with dev team to come up with fixes based on order of risk, 
- Perform testing based on risk 
- Review testing methods to better catch bugs.

### 2. Whatâ€™s the best way to prioritize testing when working under time pressure for a hotfix?

1. Order the testing based on the risk associated with the error
2. Performing regression testing 
3. Functional testing

### 3. How can QA help ensure stability in production while still allowing fast bug fixes?

- Collaborate with dev team to perform testing during development
- Deploy automated testing
- Maintaining clear communication with development team
