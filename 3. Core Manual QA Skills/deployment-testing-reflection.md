# Understanding Deployment & Hotfix Testing

## Reflection

### If a release goes live and users immediately report issues, what should QA do?

Handle incoming feedback from users and document and enter into tracking system after validating, contact dev team, collaborate with dev team to come up with fixes based on order of risk, perform testing based on risk and finally review testing methods to better catch bugs.

### Whatâ€™s the best way to prioritize testing when working under time pressure for a hotfix?

Order the testing based on the risk associated with the error, performing regression testing and then functional testing

### How can QA help ensure stability in production while still allowing fast bug fixes?

Collaborate with dev team to perform testing during development, deploy automated testing, maintaining clear communication with development team
