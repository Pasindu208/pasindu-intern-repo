# Understanding how to do manual QA

## Reflection

### 1. Why is context important in testing, and how might testing Focus Bear differ from testing another app?

- Focus Bear specifically targets users needing productivity and distraction management with ADHD or similar challenges
- In Focus Bear the  accuracy of the distraction blocking needs to be high 

### 2. How can manual testing be both structured and adaptable at the same time?

By adhering principles such as the following:

- Defined testing plans
    - Have clearly documented test cases that specify all requirements to be tested
    - When carrying out testing, the QAs can then refer, modify, and add new test cases and findings
- Implement testing timeframes
    - Organize testing with proper timeframes and goals while allowing for some additional time to explore any issues that can pop up
- Approach based on risk
    - Testing should be approached based on risk so that issues can be prioritized accordingly
    - Strategies should be shifted if any new risks are found
- Regular/Continuous feedback
    - Use retrospectives and collaborative tools to refine test plans based on changing requirements and risks

### 3. How would you approach testing a new feature in Focus Bear without a predefined test script?

- Get clarity on the feature from product managers, developers so that I can understand the functionalities, goals and expectations of the feature
- Conduct testing in a exploratory manner, documenting findings and any insights that include unexpected behaviour, any possible edge cases
- Continuously document test findings clearly and promptly for stakeholders.
- Provide timely feedback to developers for rapid improvement and adjustments.

### 4. How do you decide what to test when no detailed requirements are provided?

- Engaging with stakeholders
    - Communicate with product owners, developers, users to get clarity on intended functionality and expectations
    - Document all gathered insights on requirements 
    - Continuously review and refine testing based on feedback from stakeholders and the development team.
- Refer any similar work
    - Check on any comparable features/applications to understand the general expectations 
    - Follow available industry standards and best practices
- Approach based on risk
    - Adapt testing focus dynamically as new risks are uncovered
