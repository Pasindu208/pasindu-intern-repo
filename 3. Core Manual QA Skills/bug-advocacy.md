# Bug Advocacy â€“ Reporting Bugs Effectively

## Reflection

### 1. How would you report a UI glitch vs. a critical login failure differently?

- UI glitches 
    - Tag as low priority.
    - Include clear steps to reproduce.
    - Describe expected vs. actual outcomes.
    - Attach relevant screenshots or recordings.

- Critical login failures 
    - Tag as high priority.
    - Provide detailed reproduction steps.
    - Explain the immediate impact on user and system functionality.
    - Attach screenshots, recordings, and logs.
    - Justify severity clearly to expedite resolution.
 
### 2. If a developer dismisses a bug as "not important," how would you advocate for fixing it?

- Clarify the specific user impact of the bug.
- Present evidence from affected users or customer feedback.
- Highlight long-term consequences if left unresolved.
- Engage collaboratively to agree on prioritizing the fix.
 
### 3. How can screenshots, logs, and screen recordings improve your bug reports?

- Screenshots/Recordings: Provide clear visual context, making the issue easier to understand and replicate.
- Logs: Offer detailed technical insights, capturing API responses, console errors, or backend issues, enabling faster identification and resolution.
- Recordings: Clearly demonstrate the precise reproduction steps, removing ambiguity and improving the accuracy of debugging.
