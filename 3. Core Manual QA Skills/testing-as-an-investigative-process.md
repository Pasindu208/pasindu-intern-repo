# Testing as an Investigative Process 

## Reflection

### 1. What questions would you ask when testing a new Focus Bear feature for the first time?

- Details on the feature:
    - What is the purpose of the feature
    - What are the dependencies of this feature
    - How is the feature expected to work
- Details for testing:
    - Is the feature on all platforms or only in some (Windows/iOS/Android/MacOS)
    - What are the performance targets for the system
    - What are the permissions required for the feature to work
    - What is logged when the feature is running

### 2. How can uncertainty and curiosity make you a better tester?

- Uncertainty:
    - If I am uncertain about the system, it will make me explore and investigate it more in order to seek out issues. 
    - Any bias about functionalities in the system will not be present because I am not familiar about the system
    - I would also be more comfortable asking questions due to the unfamiliarity
- Curiosity:
    - Being curious will drive me to explore the 'behind the scenes' of functionalities even if I am familiar of how it works on a higher level
    - I will be motivated to learn more and enhance my skills to better test the system
    - Curiosity will help me gain a deep understanding of all the requirements and functions of the system

### 3. What techniques could you use to dig deeper when a bug is difficult to reproduce?

- Use monitoring and logging tools with effective filters and have necessary metrics set to be displayed
- Replicate the necessary environment as close as possible
- Update documentation and any automated tests to include capturing the bug so that it is not missed in the future
