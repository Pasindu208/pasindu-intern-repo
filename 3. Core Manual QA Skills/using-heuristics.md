# Using Heuristics to Guide Testing

## Reflection

### 1. If you had only 15 minutes to test a new Focus Bear feature, how would heuristics help you decide what to test first?

Heuristics like RCR (recently changed, commonly used, risky) will focus the attention on places where bugs are most likely to be found in, which I think is the best approach in a time constrained situation.

### 2. How can heuristics help you find edge cases and unexpected bugs?

Heuristics can guide us off the usual testing path, such as to input conflicting data into the system, normal user activity such as multi tasking.

### 3. What risks come with using gut instinct vs. structured test cases?

- Relying only on gut instinct can lead to missed scenarios, especially when pressure is high or complexity is hidden.
- Structured test cases ensure broader coverage, but heuristics can complement them by introducing creative and intuitive testing paths.
